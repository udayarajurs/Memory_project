Introduction
This is a code repository for the corresponding video tutorial - https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6QREj8te1P7VSwhrMf3D3Xt4V6_SRkhu.

Using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB you'll learn how to build a Full Stack MERN Application - from start to finish. The App is called "Memories" and it is a simple social media app that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their lives.

By the end of this video, you will have a strong understanding of how the MERN Stack works.

Setup:

run npm i && npm start for both client and server side to start the app
TODO: rename post message, refactor reducers, add some cool memories, maybe clickable tags, fix update functionality
